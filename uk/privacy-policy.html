		    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy will explain what information we collect online, why we collect it, and the choices we offer to you.</p>
<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes the data practices of Wizards of OBS, LLC (“<strong>Company</strong>”), covering its services under its control, including the website known as <a href="https://obsproject.com/">https://obsproject.com</a>, and any other website, downloadable software, or mobile application (collectively "Services"). By using the Services, you are consenting to this Policy and the processing of your data in the manner provided in this Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Services. This Privacy Policy was last updated on July 2, 2021. </p>
<p><strong>Information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We may collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, such as data regarding your usage of the Services and activity in the Services. We collect PII, DII, and log information about your interactions as described below.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to identify or contact you online or offline, such as your name, address, email, phone number, photos or audio data, and payment information, or data that is linked to such identifiers. The Services may collect PII when it is provided to us, such as when you sign up to our forums. </p>
<p>We may also create or collect device-identifiable information (DII), such as cookies, unique device identifiers, statistical identifiers and similar identifiers that are linkable to a browser or device. From these platforms, we may also receive other information, such as your IP address, user agent, timestamps, precise and imprecise geolocation, sensor data, apps, fonts, battery life information, and screen size. When you use the OBS Studio software, a device identifier is created and sent to us as part of the automatic update check so that we can better gauge the number of active users.</p>
<p>Our Services may also collect information about your interactions with our website, including navigation paths, search queries, timestamps, and referral URLs. We may also partner with third-parties such as Google Analytics that collect additional information – please see their privacy policies for more details and see below for your choices regarding these parties.</p>
<p>Depending on your use of the software, we may collect information from 3rd parties that you have authorized to provide information to us, for example connecting your Twitch and YouTube account.</p>
<p><strong>Categories of PII We Collect</strong>: Within the past 12 months, we may have collected the following information from users of OBS Forums that include OBS Studio Support, Resources, and Development (collectively, “OBS Forums”):</p>

<p><strong>How we use information we collect</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect from our Services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Services, to develop new Services and offerings, and to protect us and our users.</p>
<p>PII is primarily used for business purposes required to provide the Services. When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication as well as the other information to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our Services, such as letting you know about changes or improvements, if you have opted-in to such communications. We also use your PII for the following business purposes: </p>
<ol>
<li>To meet the reason for which the PII was provided. </li>
<li>To provide you with information or services you request from us.</li>
<li>To improve our website and performance of the contents therein.</li>
<li>To resolve disputes.</li>
<li>Preventing potentially fraudulent, prohibited, or illegal activities. </li>
<li>Enforcing the Terms of Service. </li>
<li>Performing other duties as required by law. </li>
</ol>
<p>We may share PII and DII with companies, outside organizations, and individuals for limited reasons and the following business purposes, outlined below: </p>
<ol>
<li>We may share PII and other data with companies, outside organizations or individuals if we have your consent to do so.</li>
<li>For external processing - We may provide PII to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
<li>For legal reasons - We may share PII with companies, outside organizations or individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
<li>In case of a sale or asset transfer - If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including PII collected from you through your use of our Services, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Services.</li>
<li>We may share anonymized, aggregated information and DII with our partners such as businesses we have a relationship with, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information to show trends about the general use of our services.</li>
</ol>
<p>We disclose your PII for business purposes to the following categories of third-parties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our affiliates</li>
<li>Services providers</li>
<li>APIs</li>
<li>Third-parties</li>
</ol>
<p>We use DII to operate our Services and manage user sessions, including analyzing usage of our Services and preventing malicious behavior and fraud. We may share DII with third-parties primarily for analytics purposes, for external processing, and for security purposes.</p>
<p>Information received from 3rd parties that you have granted us access to will only be used for the provided purposes. For example, when linking your Twitch account, Twitch will send us an access token for your channel. We forward this directly to the OBS Studio software running on your computer and do not store or otherwise process it.</p>
<p>You may opt to connect your YouTube / Google account to OBS Studio. This integration is entirely local - the OBS Studio software running on your computer receives the information directly from YouTube / Google. This data is only used for its intended purpose of managing your YouTube broadcasts through the OBS Studio software and is not forwarded or sent to any 3rd parties, including us. For further information on how YouTube / Google use the data sent to them, please refer to their relevant privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties</strong></p>
<p>While we strive to work with reputable companies with good privacy practices, this Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on the Services. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites, including social networks. We may use third-parties to obtain analytics about the users of our site. For further information, please see the relevant privacy policies for each third-party and industry codes of conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Information security</strong></p>
<p>We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, since no software or storage system is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee for the security of your information associated with the Services, or any other service for that matter. You can help protect your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords. We retain data for the maximum amount of time allowable under applicable law. </p>
<p><strong>Children Under 13</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect information for any child under the age of 13. If you are the parent of a child under the age of 13 and have a concern regarding your child’s information on our Services, please contact us at the email provided at the end of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Policy changes on this page. Please check back periodically to view changes to our privacy policy.</p>
