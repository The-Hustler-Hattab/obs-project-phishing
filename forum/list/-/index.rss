Before the recent update, they usually recorded the full 70 - 180 minute durations of what I was trying to record. Sometimes it would stop recording sooner than desired, but eventually that seemed to stop malfunctioning and recordings were recording the full durations until i selected to stop recordings and save them. <br />

But now the most recent times Ive recorded via my webcam, obs records video and audio fine but only for an hour or...<br />

<br />
Hi, I mistakenly set the output timer to 1 hour instead of 2 hours to record something. After hitting &quot;start&quot;, it seems there is no way to change or cancel the timer without stopping the already running recording session.  It would be nice if I can actually cancel or change the timer without stopping first so that the recording is not split. Thanks.</div>]]></content:encoded>

Newbie here and a noob at OBS Studio as well. :( <br />
I am seeking for some recommendations to fix a couple of problems that we have while streaming with OBS. <br />
Firstly, we use IP Cameras (not sure which build) that are wide-angled because the ceiling is not so high. So the video always looks stretched out (attachment 1). Is there any way this can be fixed on the output end?<br />

Secondly, sometimes there is a burned patch appearing on the video if some objects move across (attachment...<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
What is the best workflow to automate obs streaming a scheduled playlist that will be managed by an in-house application, I did a workaround by adding a scene with vlc source form a directory and I tried to drop files in this folder continuously but it seems the vlc source will play only clips located when starting, does creating multiple scene and trying to auto switch them will help in this case?<br />
Or any...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I am currently using Closed Captioning via Google Speech Recognition 0.0.8.<br />
This plug-in converts my voice into text in real time.<br />
This text is entered as an OBS source and disappears after a while.<br />
I want to convert this real-time text into AI voice and send it to the broadcast using this text source. <br />
Is there a TTS plugin for this?<br />
I searched, but I only see TTS plugins for donations or chatting.<br />
Any help please?</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Since I'm new, not even sure I'm posting in correct area; apologies if in wrong area, and let me know where I should be posting with beginner's questions.  Thanks.  I'm learning as I go, starting with screen capture and then planning on streaming at some point thereafter.  I was hoping OBS would allow me to simply screen capture without registering an acvount.  Is that possible?  If so, how??</div>]]></content:encoded>
